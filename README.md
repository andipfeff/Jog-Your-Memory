## Overview
_Topic_: Develop an interactive app that displays a running/walking route based on user inputs (below) and predicts the route's popularity rating.
* User enters route coordinates 

OR
* User enters location, route distance, and elevation change ranges

_Hypotheses/Questions:_
1. Does location directly correlate to the popularity of a route/trail?
2. Does distance directly correlate to the popularity of a route/trail? 
3. Does elevation change directly correlate to the popularity of a route/trail? 

_Data Sources to explore_:
   * AllTrails API
   * Google Places for Points of Interest
   * Google Dataset Search

_Approach_:  Use Supervised Machine Learning such as LogisticRegression to create a model that predicts if a route will be popular (highly rated) based on location, distance, and/or elevation change. Plot the route using Mapbox and Leaflet.

_Additional features, time permitting_:
* Map overlay with points of interest (restaurants, pubs, ice cream shops, parks, landmarks, high crime, etc.)
* Use Machine Learning to analyze points of interest or other features.
___
## Resources:
_Applications_:
*  Python/Pandas
*  SQL/Postgres
*  Mapbox & Leaflet (Javascript and HTML)
*  Matplotlib
*  Tableau
*  Google Slides?
