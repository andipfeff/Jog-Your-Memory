# Jog-Your-Memory
## Overview
Topic - Develop an app that predicts the rating of a running/walking route based on user interaction defined below:
* user enters distance and elevation change ranges
* user enters route coordinates 
* Supervised Machine Learning predicts rating of the route

Additional features, time permitting:
* Points of Interest (restaurants, pubs, ice cream shops, parks, landmarks, high crime) - map overlay or ratings, etc.
* Use ML to analyze POI or other features

_Hypotheses_
*   Does distance directly correlate (predict) the popularity (measured by rating) of a route/trail? 
*   Does elevation change directly correlate (predict) the popularity (measured by rating) of a route/trail? 

_Data Sources_:
   * AllTrails API
   * Google Places for Points of Interest

Approach:  Use Supervised Machine Learning such as LogisticRegression to create a model that predicts if a route will be highly rated based on distance and elevation change. Plot the route and if time allows, add an overlay with Points of Interest.
